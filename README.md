## Clinical Reasoning Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load patient case history from various formats (TXT, JSON, CSV).
- Perform data cleaning: remove missing values, normalize text, and standardize formats.
- Extract relevant medical features and symptoms.

### 2. Generating Patient Profiles
- Utilize OpenAI API to summarize patient history.
- Identify key symptoms, risk factors, and preliminary insights.
- Represent patient information in a structured format.

### 3. Conceptual Knowledge Graph (CKG) Generation
- Construct a graph with relevant nodes (symptoms, conditions, tests).
- Assign weighted edges based on medical literature and case data.
- Use OpenAI API to infer relationships between entities.

### 4. Tuning the CKG
- Allow manual adjustments by medical professionals.
- Optimize edge weights and node relationships using domain knowledge.
- Refine the graph using iterative AI-based feedback loops.

### 5. Generating Differential Diagnosis
- Query the CKG to find the most probable diagnoses.
- Rank differential diagnoses based on likelihood scores.
- Cross-reference with historical case data and medical databases.

### 6. Determining Final Diagnosis
- Validate differential diagnosis using clinical guidelines and expert feedback.
- Consider additional tests or imaging if needed.
- Generate a final diagnosis with confidence scores.

This structured pipeline ensures accurate and explainable clinical decision-making by integrating AI-driven knowledge representation with expert-driven refinements.
